## Introduction
Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform. In Azure, we can develop the program or product, test and deploy it easily using their wide range of solutions.
Azure also provides the services by means of monitoring and managing these developed applications in terms of resources usage, application performances, logging about network traffic etc.
These solutions are widely classified into three categories : 
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
